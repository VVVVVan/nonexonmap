Description: nemapping plots the map of non-exon existed in reads in the 
            final transcript sequences assembled by De Novo (Trinity). 
            The distribution is based on the number of reads that have 
            non-exon sequences overlap with the exon sequence. 
            Furthermore, a graph or chart should produced for visualization.
