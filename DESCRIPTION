Description: nonexonmap plots the map of non-exon sequences existed in reads in
            the final transcript sequences assembled by De Novo (Trinity). 
            Since that the output file is just palin text, the plot and map of
            reads is an improvement. It analyzes the position of non-exon 
            sequences on reference sequences. Furthermore, it checkes if the
            non-exon are introns and give the percentage of introns in the 
            non-exon sequences. Rsubread and Rsamtools are used to align the
            sequences. A chart is produced for visualization.
