Description: nonexonmap maps the non-exon sequences existed in reads to
            the final transcript sequences assembled from reads by De Novo (Trinity). 
            Since that the output file is just plain text, the map of reads
            is an improvement. It clearly shows the position of non-exon sequences
            on reference sequence. Furthermore, it verifies if the non-exon 
            sequences are introns and gives the percentage of introns in the 
            non-exon sequences. A ggplot is produced to Shiny app for visualization.
            Rsubread and Rsamtools are used to align the sequences.
